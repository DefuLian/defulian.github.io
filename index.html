<p> Defu Lian is now a research professor at School of Computer Science and Technology and School of Data Science, <a href="http://www.ustc.edu.cn/" target="_blank">University of Science and Technology of China</a>. Prior to that, he was an Associate Professor at <a href="http://www.uestc.edu.cn/" target="_blank">University of Electronic Science and Technology of China</a>. He visited University of Technology Sydney from March 2017 to April 2018, working with Prof. Longbing Cao. During his PhD period, he has been a visit student at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/" target="_blank">Microsoft Research Asia</a> for four years, supervised by Dr. Xing Xie. </p> <br>

<p> He received his Ph.D. at the MOE-Microsoft Key laboratory,  University of Science and Technology of China in June 2014, co-supervised by Dr. Xing Xie and Prof. Enhong Chen, and received his B.E. at School of Computer Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China in June 2009.</p><br>

<p>His research interest is data mining and machine learning in the areas of recommender systems, spatio-temporal and education. He has published over 40 referred paper at reputable international conferences and journals in his research areas, such as KDD, TKDE, TOIS and TIST. He has received the best student paper runner up in APWeb 2016.
